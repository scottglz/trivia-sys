It's a spoooooky new Tuesday Trivia!  Actually, I'm writing this intro before I add the weekly questions, but I strongly suspect they will not be particularly spoooooky.  I'm not going to accidentally railroad myself into a writing an annual Halloween-themed quiz, that's for sure.  But I hope the seven questions below, whatever they are, turn out to be tricky...and I hope you'll consider them to be a treat.

Our ace grader Lilly tells me that scores from our last ten-week challenge are now finalized at https://ken-jennings.us3.list-manage.com/track/click?u=394e95b19b233d8a2fcf8840d&id=94f064b06d&e=9e5e869827 and we have a winner!  David Edery will receive a signed copy of PLANET FUNNY, my new book about the comedy takeover of modern culture.  The rest of you can get a valuable unsigned copy by buying it from a store!  You can preview the book and get some purchasing options at https://ken-jennings.us3.list-manage.com/track/click?u=394e95b19b233d8a2fcf8840d&id=d2ba671d8e&e=9e5e869827.

==============================================

As with all good trivia, it is entirely possible to Google the answers to the questions above.  So you're on the honor system here: no peeking, and only send in the answers you knew off the top of your head.  Answers will appear in next week's mailing.

The seventh and final question every week is a "What do they have in common?" question, designed to be Google-resistant, but also to be solved without any outside help.  As I arrange to send out goodies to high scorers, it will be on the basis of these seventh questions only.

Send responses to tuesdaytrivia@ken-jennings.com by noon Pacific each following Monday.  That's also the address to contact if the quiz ever fails to show up and you need to request a replacement.  You have received this e-mail because your address was submitted to the mailing list at www.ken-jennings.com.
